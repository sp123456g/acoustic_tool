type make to compile the main program for whistle detector

Try to form the wav file into the csv file like 10k_sin_noise.wav.csv 

and then into the csv file in command line:

Ex: 
    ./detect 96k_fs_1sec.wav.csv 1 1 

    first argument:     1 means do the detection 0 means only do spectrogram
    second argument:    channel number: mono for 1 and stereo for 2

    If you want to save the matrix, use saveData function in main or save_data function in detection_algorithm.cpp file
